# The Distant Future: The Year 2000

## Project Concept
### Description
[BattleBots](https://battlebots.com/) is an American robot combat television series that features armed and armoured robots fighting each other for audience entertainment. In a satirical critique of robot combat and BattleBots in particular, this performance gives the robots a voice; two voices, to be precise. The performance is a comedic take of the possible context of a robot fight, dramatizing and parodying the clich√©s of robot combat. Blue, a robot minding his own business, happens upon the aggressive and territorial Red, who is larger and better equipped; yet, in a twist of fate, Blue grievously injures Red, who dies a glorious death... Or does he? In *another* twist of fate, Red joins Blue in his rendition of 'De Camptown Races' by Al Jolson.
