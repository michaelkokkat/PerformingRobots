# The Distant Future: The Year 2000

## Project Concept
### Description
[BattleBots](https://battlebots.com/) is an American robot combat television series that features armed and armoured robots fighting each other for audience entertainment. In a satirical critique of robot combat and BattleBots in particular, this performance gives the robots a voice; two voices, to be precise. The performance is a comedic take of the possible context of a robot fight, dramatizing and parodying the clichés of robot combat. Blue, a robot minding his own business, happens upon the aggressive and territorial Red, who is larger and better equipped; yet, in a twist of fate, Blue grievously injures Red, who dies a glorious death... Or does he? In *another* twist of fate, Red joins Blue in his rendition of 'De Camptown Races' by Al Jolson.


## Robot Specifications
Both robots have similar dimensions, with Red being longer than Blue, and being made in two separate parts (pre-broken). Both robots are primarily constructed out of wood, with cardboard lids for easier access to the electronics inside.

The robots are controlled by Arduino microcontrollers and are entirely autonomous. The arms attached to the servos are made from foam core board, and the "blade" attached to Red is made from recycled copper PCB.
